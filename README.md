# Totemgen

Totemgen is a free and opensource tool for generating data sculptures. It was developed to simplify the process of translating table data into three-dimensional shapes. Look up data physicalization if you want to learn more (or read my thesis :P ... link coming soon when it will be finished).

This is my first open-source project :) If I made some mistake in the ReadMe please let me know ! Every bit of help is greatly appreciated.
